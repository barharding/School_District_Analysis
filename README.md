# School District Analysis
## Overview 
The school board believes the 9th grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School are showing signs of acedemic dishonesty.  The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the impact to the mean scores when the grade nine scores for Thomas High School (THS) are excluded from the analysis.  A before and after comparison should be telling if cheating has occurred.  

## Results
In the results below, the images will show the results from removing the greade nine scores (first line in the image) against the original tabulation which included the grade nine scores (second line in the image) for THS.

## Summary
In summary academic dishonesty can not be found in the analysis above.  If it did exist when the THS 9th grade results were removed we would have seen some sort of drop in the mean.  Based on the evidence the mean changed by approximately 0.01% give or take in the reading and math percentages before and after.  The overall passing percentage did not change drastically either.  The conclusion is no dishonesty can be detected in this data set.
